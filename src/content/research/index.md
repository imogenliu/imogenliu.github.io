# Research

My research agenda focuses on the international political economy of development and global governance, with an emphasis on how international institutions shape economic policy and outcomes across countries.

## Current Projects

- **Global Economic Governance**: Studying the role of international financial institutions in shaping economic policy
- **Development Finance**: Investigating the political dynamics of international development financing
- **Politics of Inequality**: Examining how international economic policies affect domestic inequality

## Research Methods

My work employs mixed methods, combining quantitative analysis of economic data with qualitative case studies and process tracing to understand causal mechanisms in global governance.
