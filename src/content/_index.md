## Welcome

I am an Assistant Professor of International Political Economy in the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My research is animated by questions surrounding the politics and governance of finance, production and energy systems under conditions of heightened geopolitical competition. A recurring theme in my work is the role of transnational firms in shaping divergent trajectories of industrial development in Europe, China and the Global South.
