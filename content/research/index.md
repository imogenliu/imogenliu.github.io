- **Financial Geographies**: Investigating how finance shapes spatial economic development
- **China-EU Relations**: Analyzing economic and political dimensions of China's engagement with Europe
- **Infrastructure and Development**: Exploring the politics of infrastructure investment and development outcomes
- **Geoeconomics and Geopolitics**: Studying the economic dimensions of geopolitical competition

## Current Projects

- **Financialisation and Investment**: Studying financialisation processes and their societal returns
